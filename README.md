# Topic Modeling using LDA

In natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups.LDA or latent Dirichlet allocation is a “generative probabilistic model” of a collection of composites made up of parts. In terms of topic modeling, the composites are documents and the parts are words and/or phrases (n-grams).
